# Restore Debloat — reinstall apps removed by debloat.ps1
# Windows 11 Gaming Optimization Guide
# ============================================================
# Tier: Safe (reinstalls Microsoft-published apps)
#
# Reads state.packages.removed and state.packages.provisionedRemoved
# from the manifest and attempts to reinstall each package via winget.
# Falls back to a Microsoft Store search URL when winget can't find
# the package id.
#
# Pair with: debloat.ps1
# Must be run as Administrator (winget Appx scope often needs elevation
# for provisioned packages and per-machine reinstalls).
