# Manual verifier — 9 cleanup/debloat.ps1

Pester (tests/9-cleanup/debloat.Tests.ps1) covers the AST surface
including the f71d130 regression check that `$neverRemove` is
enforced. Below is what must run on Windows.

## Pre-conditions

- Fresh Windows 11 24H2 VM with a snapshot you can revert to.
- All bloatware apps from `$appsToRemove` still installed
  (i.e. user hasn't manually purged them already).
- Microsoft.WindowsStore, Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller, Photos,
  Calculator, Terminal all present.

## $neverRemove safety enforcement

The bug in f71d130 was that the safety list was declared but the
foreach loop didn't actually check it. This test confirms the fix
still holds.

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | Temporarily edit `$appsToRemove` to include `Microsoft.WindowsStore` (DO NOT COMMIT THIS) | Save the file. |
| 2 | `pwsh -File ...\9 cleanup\debloat.ps1` | Scan output shows `[SAFETY] Skipping Microsoft.WindowsStore (in NEVER-REMOVE list)` in red. |
| 3 | `Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore` | Still present (NOT removed). |
| 4 | `Get-ToolkitManifest` → `state.packages.removed` | Does NOT contain Microsoft.WindowsStore. |
| 5 | **Revert the file edit.** | Restored. |

## Standard run

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | `pwsh -File ...\9 cleanup\debloat.ps1` | Scan, preview list, pre-confirm. Press Enter. |
| 2 | Each `[N/total] <appname>...` line | Ends `Removed` for present apps, `Already gone` for ones the user purged. |
| 3 | After completion: `Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.BingNews` | Empty (removed). |
| 4 | `Get-ToolkitManifest` → `state.packages.removed` | Lists every successfully removed package. |
| 5 | `Get-ToolkitManifest` → `state.packages.provisionedRemoved` | Lists provisioned removals (per-image, prevents reinstall on new users). |

## Restore via pair script

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | `pwsh -File ...\9 cleanup\restore-debloat.ps1` | Reads manifest, lists candidates, pre-confirm. |
| 2 | Per app: winget install or Store URL fallback | Installed when winget knows the id; manual recovery URL printed otherwise. |
| 3 | `Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.BingNews` | Reappears for the per-user install path. |
| 4 | `Get-ToolkitManifest` → `state.steps['debloat-restore']` | Records installed-count vs failed-count. |

## Idempotency

| # | Action | Expected |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | After a successful run, re-run debloat.ps1 | Scan shows all apps as `[GONE]`. Script exits with `All bloatware already removed. Nothing to do.` |

## Failure modes to flag

- If any critically-protected app (Store, AppInstaller, Photos,
  Calculator, Terminal) is removed → **`$neverRemove` enforcement
  regression** (f71d130). Open issue immediately, revert the
  package via System Restore / image reimage, link the SHA.
- If `Record-ToolkitPackageRemoval` doesn't fire → restore-debloat.ps1
  has nothing to read; the user is stuck. Manifest is the audit
  trail; if it's empty after a Remove-AppxPackage call, the lib
  helper is broken.
