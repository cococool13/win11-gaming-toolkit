# FR33THY/Ultimate Integration Inventory

Source: <https://github.com/FR33THYFR33THY/Ultimate>

This is the canonical record of which FR33THY artifacts were ported into this toolkit, which were merged into existing files, and which were declined. Decisions follow the rules in `GUIDE.md` and `BIOS-CHECKLIST.md`:

- Automatable only. Manual UI / control-panel toggles go to `BIOS-CHECKLIST.md` or are skipped.
- Additive only. We do not duplicate registry keys, services, or commands we already manage.
- Tracked via `lib/toolkit-state.ps1`. Untracked writes break revert and verify.
- Three risk tiers: `Safe`, `Advanced`, `Security Trade-off`. No new tiers.
- No bundled binaries. Tools download at runtime with SHA-256 verification.
